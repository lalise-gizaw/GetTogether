  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    GetTogether is a web application designed to foster meaningful in-person connections by helping users discover and join local events based on shared interests, moods, and activities. Whether someone is new to town, looking to meet people for a hobby, or just wants to find someone to hang out with, GetTogether makes the process easy and enjoyable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users can register with their email, create detailed profiles with bios, interests, and profile pictures, and use smart filters to browse a personalized feed of upcoming events. Events include time, location, descriptions, and categories like sports, study groups, hobbies, or casual meetups. The platform enables users to create, join, or share events and build a network of friends they can interact with.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built using Vue.js for the frontend and Firebase for authentication and real-time data management, the system prioritizes ease of use and responsiveness. Accessibility is a key focus, with ADA-compliant design features such as keyboard navigation, high contrast mode, and screen reader compatibility to ensure an inclusive user experience.
